# Overview

This is a full-stack mini golf management system called "Madras Mini Golf" built as a single deployable Node.js application. The Express backend serves the built React frontend as static files, creating a unified application that simplifies deployment and hosting. The system provides a complete player experience for playing mini golf games and an administrative interface for managing pricing, sales analytics, and game data.

# System Architecture

## Application Architecture
This is a **single deployable Node.js application** that serves both frontend and backend:

### Single Environment Mode (Current)
- **Unified Server**: Always builds and serves React app as static files + API routes
- **Static Assets**: Frontend automatically built into dist/public/ directory
- **Single Process**: One consistent Node.js process handles all requests
- **No Environment Split**: Eliminated development/production complexity
- **Simple Startup**: Build â†’ Serve, no conditional logic
- **Deployment**: Single application package for any hosting platform

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript:

- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom golf-themed color variables
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions
- **Build**: Vite bundles frontend into static assets served by Express

## Backend Architecture
Express.js server with integrated frontend serving:

- **API Layer**: RESTful routes with proper error handling and logging
- **Static Serving**: Built React app served as static files in production
- **Data Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with PostgreSQL implementation
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing and session-based authentication
- **Database**: Auto-detection between Neon (cloud) and local PostgreSQL

## Database Design
Uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations:

- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions in shared directory for type consistency
- **Relations**: Proper foreign key relationships between users, players, games, scores, and pricing
- **Data Types**: Uses UUIDs for primary keys, decimal types for monetary values, and arrays for player names
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database versioning

Key entities include users (admin), players, games, scores, and pricing history with proper relational integrity.

## Development Environment
Configured for modern development with unified production deployment:

- **Build System**: Vite for frontend development + production bundling
- **Backend Build**: ESBuild for server bundling and optimization
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking across all code
- **Path Mapping**: @ aliases for clean imports
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR in development, static serving in production
- **Single Port**: Development and production both use port 5000
- **Unified Deployment**: Single Node.js application for hosting simplicity

## Authentication & Authorization
Simple but effective security model:

- **Admin Authentication**: Session-based login for administrative functions
- **Player Flow**: Registration-based system using sessionStorage for game continuity
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based route protection for admin endpoints
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for persistence and scalability

## Game Flow Architecture
Designed for intuitive mini golf experience:

- **Registration**: Player details capture with validation
- **Game Setup**: Dynamic player count selection and name collection
- **Scoring**: Hole-by-hole score tracking with validation
- **Results**: Comprehensive score calculation and leaderboard display
- **Pricing**: Dynamic weekend/weekday pricing with administrative controls

## Analytics & Reporting
Comprehensive sales and performance tracking:

- **Time-based Analytics**: Daily, weekly, monthly, and hourly sales breakdowns
- **Revenue Tracking**: Automatic cost calculation based on player count and pricing
- **Game Statistics**: Player counts, game completion tracking, and historical data
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and trend visualization
